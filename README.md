- 👋 Hi, I’m @rogerioprazeres
- 👀 I’m interested in automatization of small daily tasks without relying in the complexity of google or Iphone assistence bots. Something as simple as having a small transponder in a daily use watch or a ring to open doors, turn on my car etc. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming in general.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on translations to Brazilian portuguese too.
- 📫 You can reach me at rogeriotemp-temp@yahoo.com.br
